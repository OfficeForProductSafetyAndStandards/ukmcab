                        As the UK exited the European Union (EU), an alternative to the previously used NANDO system was required. NANDO is the 
                        EU service that provides the same functionality across all member countries and organisations.

                        In <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold" style="color:red">xxxx</span> a UK version of NANDO was created, on Gov.UK, however it lacked functionality, specifically around the process for 
                        CAB creation and approvals from the various organisations and departments involved. These requirements, and others, are intended 
                        to be delivered with the bespoke developed UKMCAB service.

                        UKMCAB is currently in the Public Beta phase. This is where a web site or a service is continually developed to an agreed 
                        set of requirements and is delivered in shorter phases of multiple releases. This ensures that the service is always developing, 
                        unlike many traditional technology projects where updates can take months and years to reach the user. The service is tested and 
                        improved with the help of users who offer feedback or agree to participate in user research. Both of which can influence how the 
                        future service is changed.

                        The PUBLIC BETA is the Minimum Viable Product. It is what is required from the site to meet the basic needs of the business owners 
                        and the users. In the case of the UKMCAB service the PUBLIC BETA is to replace the existing interim site with the same level of functionality.

                    <p class='govuk-body'>
                        From the PUBLIC BETA the project will continuously release updates through a series of phases which will deliver larger areas of functionality, 
                        such as approvals processes.

                            The reason to randomise entries is to ensure that there is a fair distribution of bodies, and a body entered with a name of “A1” will not 
                            always appear first.

                            When a blank search is performed, i.e. no search term is entered, all the CAB records in the system are displayed. Blank searches can be performed by the user by pressing search 
                            with no search term entered or filters selected, or by simply navigating to the search page from another page.
                        </p>

                            Each morning these search results are randomised. This means that if a blank search is performed in the morning and the afternoon, the results will be in the same order. If that blank search is performed the 
                            following day, the results will be in a different order.
                        </p>
                        <p class='govuk-body'>
                            The randomisation is not performed at every search as this can increase server load, cause problems with moving to the next page of the returned results for each user, as well as 
                            other technical reasons.
                        </p>

                            When a search term is entered, the sort order defaults to relevancy. When another sort order is selected, that search order takes precedence.
