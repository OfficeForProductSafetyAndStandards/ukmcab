                    The focus of this release is to improve the ability to search and find information in the service, as well as address some outstanding issues from the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release.
                    The search system has been heavily refined to deliver more accurate results in a more relevant order, prioritising certain fields over others.
                    The web addresses of Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB) profile pages are now user friendly, meaning that they contain the name of the CAB rather than a string of unique numbers.
                    Also, the titles for all CAB product schedule files have been updated from simple filenames to the full name of the product schedule, making them more meaningful to users.
