                    This makes it clearer where legislative areas are assigned and where to edit them.
                    A warning message will show when a CAB name already exists and prompt to check the duplication before continuing.
                    The process of uploading another product schedule has been improved to automatically save the details before uploading the next schedule,
                    and a small addition to the review date entry field makes it easier to complete and quicker to progress.
