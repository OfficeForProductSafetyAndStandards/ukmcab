                <p class="govuk-body">
                    21 June 2023

                    The focus of this release is to improve the ability to search and find information in the service, as well as address some outstanding issues from the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release. The search system has been heavily refined to deliver more accurate results in a more relevant order, prioritising certain fields over others. Also, the web addresses of Conformity Assessment Bodies (CAB) profile pages have been made user friendly, meaning that they contain the name of the CAB rather than a string of unique numbers.
