# Branching strategy

We use Gitflow. See https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

aka: 
- We have a main branch
- `dev` branch for development
- We feature branches off `dev` for new features
- We create release branches off dev, then merge that into main once the release is ready
